static libraries

1.i created all of these functions listed below

	0-isupper.c
	0-memset.c
	0-strcat.c
	100-atoi.c
	1-isdigit.c
	2-strchr.c
	2-strlen.c
	2-strncpy.c
	3-islower.c
	3-puts.c
	3-strcmp.c
	3-strspn.c
	4-isalpha.c
	4-strpbrk.c
	5-strstr.c
	6-abs.c
	9-strcpy.c
	_you can read about what they do in previous projects_

and compiled all with *gcc* , then i sent all of their executables into an archive names libmy.a to answer for the first task. their functions are all linked in the main.h ofcourse.

2. for the second task, ill create an executable linuc script that archives only .c files into a liball.a file
